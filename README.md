# <a name="title"></a> Kitchen::VagrantSandbox

A Test Kitchen Driver for Vagrant.

This is a fork version of Kitchen::Vagrant driver.

This driver works by generating a single Vagrantfile for each instance in a
sandboxed directory. Since the Vagrantfile is written out on disk, Vagrant
needs absolutely no knowledge of Test Kitchen. So no Vagrant plugin gem is
required.

## <a name="requirements"></a> Requirements

### <a name="dependencies-vagrant"></a> Vagrant

A Vagrant version of 1.1.0 or higher is required for this driver which means
that a [native package][vagrant_dl] must be installed on the system running
Test Kitchen.

**Note:** If you have previously installed Vagrant as a gem (a version prior
to 1.1.0), this version may be resolved first in your `PATH`. If you receive an
error message that Vagrant is too old despite having installed Vagrant as a
package, you may be required to uninstall the gem version or modify your `PATH`
environment. If you require the vagrant gem for older projects you should
consider the [vagrant-wrapper][vagrant_wrapper] gem which helps manage both
styles of Vagrant installations
([background details][vagrant_wrapper_background]).

### Vagrant Sandbox (Sahara) Plugin

This driver uses `vagrant sandbox status`, `vagrant sandbox on` and `vagrant sandbox rollback`.
To use sandbox features, you should install sahara plugin:

```
$ vagrant plugin install sahara
```

### <a name="dependencies-berkshelf"></a> Vagrant Berkshelf Plugin

If a Berksfile is present in your project's root directory, then this driver
will check to ensure that the [vagrant-berkshelf][vagrant_berkshelf] plugin is
installed.

If your project doesn't use Berkshelf then this check will be skipped.

**Note:** Prior to release 1.2.0, then name of the vagrant-berkshelf gem was
berkshelf-vagrant. This driver no longer checks for the existance of
berkshelf-vagrant, so upgrading this Vagrant plugin is recommended.

### <a name="dependencies-virtualization"></a> Virtualbox and/or VMware Fusion/Workstation

Currently this driver supports VirtualBox and VMware Fusion/Workstation.
Virtualbox is free and is the default provider for Vagrant.

[VirtualBox package][virtualbox_dl]

If you would like to use VMware Fusion/Workstation you must purchase the
software from VMware and then must also purchase the Vagrant VMware plugin.

[Vagrant VMware Plugin][vmware_plugin]

[VMware Fusion][fusion_dl]

[VMware Workstation][workstation_dl]

## <a name="installation"></a> Installation and Setup

Please read the [Driver usage][driver_usage] page for more details.

## Usage

### Destroy Vagrant VM

With this plugin, `kitchen destroy` doesn't executes `vagrant destroy` but executes `vagrant sandbox rollback`.
If you would like to destroy vagrant VM, please set `KITCHEN_DESTROY_VM` env variable:
```
KITCHEN_DESTROY_VM=1 kitchen destroy [(all|<REGEX>)] [opts]
```

## <a name="default-config"></a> Default Configuration

This driver can determine the Vagrant box name and download URL for a select
number of platforms. Currently, the following platform names are supported:

```ruby
---
platforms:
- name: ubuntu-10.04
- name: ubuntu-12.04
- name: ubuntu-12.10
- name: ubuntu-13.04
- name: centos-5.9
- name: centos-6.4
- name: debian-7.1.0
```

This will effectively generate a configuration similar to:

```ruby
---
platforms:
- name: ubuntu-10.04
  driver_config:
    box: opscode-ubuntu-10.04
    box_url: https://opscode-vm-bento.s3.amazonaws.com/vagrant/opscode_ubuntu-10.04_provisionerless.box
- name: ubuntu-12.04
  driver_config:
    box: opscode-ubuntu-12.04
    box_url: https://opscode-vm-bento.s3.amazonaws.com/vagrant/opscode_ubuntu-12.04_provisionerless.box
- name: ubuntu-12.10
  driver_config:
    box: opscode-ubuntu-12.10
    box_url: ...
# ...
```

## <a name="config"></a> Configuration

### <a name="config-box"></a> box

**Required** This determines which Vagrant box will be used. For more
details, please read the Vagrant [machine settings][vagrant_machine_settings]
page.

There is **no** default value set.

### <a name="config-box-url"></a> box\_url

The URL that the configured box can be found at. If the box is not installed on
the system, it will be retrieved from this URL when the virtual machine is
started.

There is **no** default value set.

### <a name="config-provider"></a> provider

This determines which Vagrant provider to use when testing and should match
the provider name in Vagrant. For example, to use VMware Fusion the provider
should be `vmware_fusion`. Please see the docs on [providers][vagrant_providers]
for further details.

By default the value is unset, or `nil`. In this case the driver will use the
Vagrant default provider which at this current time is **virtualbox**

### <a name="config-customize"></a> customize

A **Hash** of customizations to a Vagrant virtual machine.  Each key/value
pair will be passed to your providers customization block. For example, with
the default `virtualbox` provider:

```ruby
driver_config:
  customize:
    memory: 1024
    cpuexecutioncap: 50
```

will generate a Vagrantfile configuration similar to:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # ...

  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |virtualbox|
    virtualbox.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
    virtualbox.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpuexecutioncap", "50"]
  end
end
```

Please read the [Vagrantfile configuration][vagrantfile] page for
more details.

By default, each Vagrant virtual machine is configured with 256 MB of RAM. In
other words the default value for `customize` is `{:memory => '256'}`.

### <a name="config-dry-run"></a> dry\_run

Useful when debugging Vagrant CLI commands. If set to `true`, all Vagrant CLI
commands will be displayed rather than executed.

The default is unset, or `nil`.

### <a name="config-network"></a> network

An **Array** of network customizations for the virtual machine. Each Array
element is itself an Array of arguments to be passed to the `config.vm.netork`
method. For example:

```ruby
driver_config:
  network:
  - ["forwarded_port", {guest: 80, host: 8080}]
  - ["private_network", {ip: "192.168.33.33"}]
```

will generate a Vagrantfile configuration similar to:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # ...

  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8080
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.33"
end
```

Please read the Vagrant [networking basic usage][vagrant_networking] page for
more details.

There is **no** default value set.

### <a name="config-use-vagrant-provision"></a> use_vagrant_provision

Determines whether or not this driver will use a `vagrant provision` shell out
in the **converge** action. If this value is falsey (`nil`, `false`) the
behavior from `Kitchen::Driver::SSHBase` will be used, bypassing the Vagrant
Chef solo provisioner. If this value is truthy, a `vagrant provision` will
be used.

The default is unset, or `nil`.

### <a name="config-use-vagrant-berkshelf-plugin"></a> use_vagrant_berkshelf_plugin

Determines whether or not this driver will use the vagrant-berkself Vagrant
plugin to assemble cookbook dependencies. If this value if falsey (`nil`,
`false`) then the driver will skip the vagrant-berkshelf dependency check
and not activate the plugin in the rendered Vagrantfile. If this value is
truthy the opposite behvior will be used.

The default is unset, or `nil`.

### <a name="config-synced-folders"></a> synced_folders

Allow the user to specify a collection of synced folders for on each Vagrant
instance.

The default is an empty Hash, or `{}`.

### <a name="config-require-chef-omnibus"></a> require\_chef\_omnibus

Determines whether or not a Chef [Omnibus package][chef_omnibus_dl] will be
installed. There are several different behaviors available:

* `true` - the latest release will be installed. Subsequent converges
  will skip re-installing if chef is present.
* `latest` - the latest release will be installed. Subsequent converges
  will always re-install even if chef is present.
* `<VERSION_STRING>` (ex: `10.24.0`) - the desired version string will
  be passed the the install.sh script. Subsequent converges will skip if
  the installed version and the desired version match.
* `false` or `nil` - no chef is installed.

The default value is unset, or `nil`.

### <a name="config-username"></a> username

This is the username used for SSH authentication if you
would like to connect with a different account than Vagrant default user.

If this value is nil, then Vagrant parameter `config.ssh.default.username`
will be used (which is usually set to 'vagrant').

The default value is unset, or `nil`.
